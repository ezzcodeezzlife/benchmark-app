What is Benchmark?

Benchmark is an App that allows you to find Benches in no time. This App is perfect for nature enthusiasts and of course for everyone who needs to find a seating accommodation quickly. As well you are able to add Benches with our "[Add a Bench](http://benchmarkapphosting2.herokuapp.com/add)" funtion, to add Benches that are not already listed on the Map. You are also able to climb the [Leaderboard](http://benchmarkapphosting2.herokuapp.com/leaderboard) by adding Benches.
